# CircadianSMFISH

This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the figures from the paper: "The circadian oscillator analysed at the single‚Äêtranscript level", which was published in Molecular Systems Biology  (https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202010135).

Additionally, there is also a tutorial entitled "A tutorial on probabilistic models of single-cell gene expression and Bayesian inference within STAN", which provides general guidance on using STAN for Bayesian inference of single-cell gene expression datasets.
